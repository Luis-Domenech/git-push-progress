## Regular Install

Install from the VS Code Marketplace by searching for vscode-git-push-progress

## Complicated Install

Launch VS Code Quick Open (`cmd`/`ctrl` + `p`), paste the following command, and press enter.

```
ext install vscode-git-push-progress
```

## Usage

I assume you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

After committing some changes to your local branch, instead of pressing Push, press Push Progress and you'll get bit by bit progress of the git push. Very useful when uploading many large files and you have no clue at all on the progress.

<!-- `vscode-git-progress-push` will make pushing changes to remote less stressful by outputing progress -->
